there are 2 objects of string class
a = pstttt
b = pstttt
these 2 reference variable are pointing toward the same value , but  if you change the value of one reference variable , the second one will not changed

if we write a == b
this will give us true if reference riables pointing to the same object

if you only wants to check the value use .equals method
