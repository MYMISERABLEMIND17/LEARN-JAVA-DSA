// so we are learning types of memory and the memory management

//so there are 3 types of language
//1} procedural => they follow the particular systmatic or the flow of the execution.
//2} functional => does not mess with existing code , not modifying the original data, we work on the copy of that data
// 3} object oriented => code+dataa = object

// STATIC V/S DYANAMIC
//static=> a}perform type check at compile time
//         b} error will show at th compile time
//         c} declare datatype before using it
//         d} more control
//
//
//dynamic=> a}perform type check at runtime , matlab sab kuch ho gaya ,   jab run hota hai tab check karinge
//          b} error will show at th compile time
//          c} no need to declre datatype


//memory management
//consider int a = 10
//1} stack memory => a(_reference variable )
//2} heap memory => 10 (_object)
