//In this section we will study how java code executes
// 1} => .javafile => this is a simple java file (source code)
// 2} => .classfile => after compiling the .javafile , we get the .classfile which has {byte code in it(not human redable)}
// 3} => machine code => interperter will give the machine code 0 and 1 , from .class file

//PLATFORM INDEPENDENCE
//1} byte code will run on all the Operating system
//but ......
//java virtual machine is platform dependend , different for different machine or os


//JDK => jre +development tools
//JRE  =>jvm + library classes
//JVM => java virtual machine


//JDK => a package , a set of files ,
//javac = compiler
//and lots of other things
